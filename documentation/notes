I love collecting music. 

But, I found that as my collection started growing, it was difficult to track where the album came from. 

Whether it was gifted to me by someone, purchased at a concert, or which record store it came from.

So, I wanted the ability to attach a personalized note and photo memory to the album. 

I also wanted a way to view my friends albums and make comments or leave recommendations for new music. 

This is Vinyl House!
